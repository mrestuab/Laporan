Most people face accessibility issues for medical devices, particularly regarding costs and limited stock information at healthcare facilities. The purpose of this research is to build \textit{MedisLink}, a \textit{web-based information system} that connects medical equipment lending and donation. This system will facilitate clear and effective relationships between donors and users in need. The system technology development uses a \textit{separated architecture} with \textit{React.js} on the \textit{frontend}, \textit{Golang} (\textit{Fiber}) on the \textit{backend}, and \textit{MongoDB} as a \textit{non-relational database}. The responsive \textit{API} structure divided by \textit{functional services} supports \textit{system efficiency} and maintains \textit{user access security} through \textit{JSON Web Token} (\textit{JWT}) \textit{authentication}. The automatic equipment return \textit{notification system} is one of the featured capabilities that ensures proper \textit{inventory distribution} timing using \textit{Cron Job mechanisms} with daily intervals.

\textbf{Keywords:} \textit{MedisLink}, \textit{React.js}, \textit{Go} (\textit{Fiber}), \textit{MongoDB}, \textit{JWT}, \textit{Cron Job}.
